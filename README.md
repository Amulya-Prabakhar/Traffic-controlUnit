Description:
Academic Project of Microprocessor Project. The main aim of this project is to monitor the traffic intensity of a road segment depending on which the microprocessor takes the decision and reports the traffic status to emergency (911) systems via SMS. The system also displays the status of the traffic in a
LCD which will be placed at the entry of the road segment, so that the people can take diversions accordingly depending on their schedule.The Intelligent Traffic Monitoring Systems employs the use of an ARM Cortex M0+ microprocessor; IR Transmitters and Receivers; GSM Module to achieve this goal
